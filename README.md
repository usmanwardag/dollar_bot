## Check out the video!

To demonstrate our application's functionality and showcase its working examples, we have produced a YouTube video for the DollarSplitBot project. In this video, we showcase that the system operates as intended. You can view the video by clicking on the following link:  [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT06PTMHz7Y)

## What is new in this version?

Checkout the [this documentation](docs/Update_Version.pdf)
## Installation

The below instructions can be followed in order to set-up this bot at your end in a span of few minutes! Let's get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.

2. Start a terminal session in the directory where the project has been cloned. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt

```
3. Download and install the Telegram desktop application for your system from the following site:
 ```
 https://desktop.telegram.org/
 ```
## How to run?

1. In Telegram, search for "BotFather". Click on "Start", and enter the following command:
```
  /newbot
```
2. Follow the instructions on screen and choose a name for your bot (e.g., `dollarbot`). After this, select a username for your bot that ends with "bot". The username has to be unique. 

3. BotFather will now confirm the creation of your bot and provide a TOKEN to access the HTTP API - copy and save this token for future use.

4. In the repo directory (where you cloned it), run these commands to (i) grant execution access to a bash script, and (ii) execute that bash script to run the Telegram Bot:
```
   chmod a+x run.sh
   ./run.sh
```
   
(OR)
```
   chmod a+x run.sh
   bash run.sh
```
```Note```: It will ask you to paste the API token you received from Telegram in step 4.
A successful run will generate a message on your terminal that says "TeleBot: Started polling." 

5. In the Telegram app, search for your newly created bot by entering the username and open the same. Now, on Telegram, enter the "/start" or "menu" command, and you are all set to track your expenses!

### Run Automatically at Startup

To run the script automatically at startup / reboot, simply add the `.run_forever.sh` script to your `.bashrc` file, which executes whenever you reboot your system.

## Configuring Email Credentials for SMTP: Sending Emails from Your Account

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is a standard protocol for sending emails. It is widely used for sending email messages from one server to another. In the code, we are using SMTP to send emails via a Gmail account. Here's how the SMTP configuration and usage work:

1. **SMTP Server**: The `smtp_server` variable is set to 'smtp.gmail.com,' which is the SMTP server for Gmail. This server is responsible for sending your email messages.

2. **SMTP Port**: The `smtp_port` variable is set to 587. This is the port for TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption. Gmail uses this port for secure email communication.

3. **SMTP Username**: The smtp_username variable should be set to your own Gmail email address from which you want to send the emails. Make sure to replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail email address in the code. This ensures that the emails will be sent from your specific Gmail account.

4. **SMTP Password**: The `smtp_password` variable is set, you need to generate an "App Password". An App Password is a 16-character code that allows you to access your Gmail account without revealing your real password. To generate an App Password, follow these steps:

   - Go to your Google Account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/).
   - In the "Security" section, under "Signing in to Google", select "App Passwords".
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)" from the dropdown menus.
   - Click "Generate".
   -  Google will provide you with a 16-character App Password. Use this as your `smtp_password` in your code.

By customizing these settings, you can send emails from any email account using SMTP. Just ensure you are adhering to the security guidelines provided by your email provider.

## Testing

We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:
```
python run -m pytest test/
```

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```
