# About MyDollarBot's /budget Feature
This feature enables the user to add, remove, edit or display a budget in their expense tracker. The user can choose between an overall expense tracker, which counts every expenses made to the budget, or a category-wise expense tracker, which only counts expenses in a particular category towards the budget for that category.

The user can choose a category and add the amount for the budget to be stored in the expense tracker.
